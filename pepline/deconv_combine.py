FFC-Line-Based Deconvolution
============================
A charge-assignment + deconvolution pipeline that uses fragment-fragment
correlation (FFC) line structure as an external constraint, instead of
relying solely on isotope spacing.

Motivation
----------
Classic spacing-based deconvolution (see ``deconv_df_intensity.py``)
struggles when peaks from different charge states interleave.  Example:
a z=3 envelope at 100, 100.33, 100.66 sitting next to a z=2 envelope at
100, 100.5, 101 — the spacing search can group peaks across charges and
return wrong charges and wrong neutral masses.

This module fixes that by exploiting an *independent* constraint that
the spacing search ignores: in a 2D-PC-MS map, fragments born from the
same precursor satisfy

    i * (m/z A) + j * (m/z B)  ≈  M_parent  -  Δ      (i + j == z_parent)

Δ may be small (isotope envelope offset, neutral loss, ~0).  Each (i, j)
charge split therefore produces a *line* on the FFC map.  The line-finder
in ``line_finding.py`` already detects these.  Once we know which line an
FFC point lies on, we know its charge split — directly, without isotope
spacing.

Pipeline
--------
1. Run line finding (only lines with i + j == parent_charge are used).
   The caller supplies an explicit list of expected Parent+X offsets
   (parental, isotope satellites, neutral losses, ...) and only lines
   matching one of those offsets are kept.  This mirrors the way
   ``annotation.select_best_partition`` uses an explicit
   ``target_masses`` list.
2. For each FFC point that lies on at least one line, record (charge_A,
   charge_B).  Special case: if the point lies on the parental line
   (matched_offset == parental_offset), it must lie on that line ONLY;
   otherwise multiple line assignments per point are allowed and each
   produces an output row.
3. Convert each charged m/z to its charge-1-equivalent
   (the singly-protonated m/z that the same fragment would have):

       mz1  =  z * mz  -  (z - 1) * proton

   This puts every fragment on a common axis where the spacing-based
   deconvoluter can group isotopologues unambiguously.
4. Run the existing isotope-envelope grouping + theo_patt monoisotopic
   refinement on the charge-1-equivalent values.
5. Return only the FFCs that were successfully assigned a charge.

Outputs
-------
A dict with three DataFrames:
    "annotated"  -- original FFC rows + charge_A, charge_B, line info,
                    deconvoluted m/z (charge-1 equivalent), neutral mass,
                    isotope similarity.  Multiple rows per original FFC
                    if it sits on multiple non-parental lines.
    "replaced"   -- same shape as annotated, but with m/z A and m/z B
                    replaced by deconvoluted neutral masses.
    "line_map"   -- one row per (FFC point, line) assignment; tells you
                    which line each FFC was attributed to.

    Detect FFC lines whose Parent+X offset matches one of the
    user-supplied ``expected_offsets`` (within ``offset_tol``).

    The deviation list lets the caller specify exactly which physical
    lines are expected (e.g. parental at 0, isotope satellites at
    +1.003, +2.006, neutral-loss lines at -229 for a side-chain loss,
    etc.) and discards every other cluster the line-finder might pick
    up.  This mirrors the way ``annotation.select_best_partition`` uses
    an explicit ``target_masses`` list.

    Charge-conservation rule
    ------------------------
    The constraint on (i, j) charge splits depends on the *sign* of the
    matched offset:

    * **Non-negative offsets** (parental at 0, isotopic satellites at
      +1.003, +2.006, ...): the precursor's full charge is observed in
      the two charged fragments, so we require ``i + j == parent_charge``.

    * **Negative offsets** (e.g. -18 Da water loss, -229 Da side-chain
      loss): a fragment can carry away mass as a neutral, in which case
      the two charged fragments do not need to add up to the full
      precursor charge.  We allow any ``i + j <= parent_charge``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    expected_offsets : list of float
        Allowed Parent+X values (Da).  Detected lines outside this set
        are dropped.
    offset_tol : float
        Maximum |detected_offset - expected_offset| to accept (Da).

        matched_offset, point_indices
    sorted by n_points descending.  ``matched_offset`` records which
    entry from ``expected_offsets`` the line was attributed to.

    Pick the monoisotopic shift by **maximum cosine similarity**.

    Local override of ``deconv_df_intensity.determine_monoisotopic_mz``.
    The upstream version uses a "look up nearest theoretical envelope by
    mass-of-max, read its max_peak_index, apply that as the shift" rule.
    That heuristic only works when the lookup table densely covers the
    relevant mass range; for sparse lookups (e.g. a ~3 Da gap to the
    nearest theo entry) it returns the wrong shift while the cosine
    similarity it computes alongside is just used as a confidence
    score, not as the selector.

    This refiner instead enumerates every plausible shift k, looks up
    the theoretical envelope at the corresponding hypothetical mono
    mass, aligns observed peaks to theoretical positions, and picks
    the k with the highest cosine similarity.  This makes the choice
    *evidence-driven* rather than *table-driven*.

    Shift sweep range
    -----------------
    The number of shifts to try is bounded above by ``max_shift``.
    When ``max_shift`` is None (default), the bound is auto-scaled
    with the anchor's mass: ``floor(anchor_mass / 1500) + 2``.  The
    rationale is that for an averagine-like polymer the most intense
    isotope sits roughly at index ``mass / 1800``, so a fragment at
    ~3500 Da has its tallest peak around index 2-3.  Adding +2 of
    headroom guarantees we cover the true shift even when the
    observed envelope is heavily truncated to its top isotopes.  For
    a 1000 Da fragment this gives 2 shifts; for 5000 Da, 5 shifts.

    Note: the sweep is *not* limited by the number of observed peaks.
    A two-peak envelope of a 4 kDa molecule may legitimately need a
    shift of 3 or 4 (the two observed peaks being indices 3-4 of the
    true envelope).  Limiting the sweep to ``n_obs - 1`` would miss
    such cases.

    Deconvolute a pool of charge-1-equivalent m/z values.

    Strategy
    --------
    Forget which side of the FFC each value came from and pool every
    unique (charge-1-equivalent m/z, precursor charge) pair together,
    run the standard 1D isotope-envelope deconvoluter on each charge
    class separately, then map the monoisotopic result back to every
    input row that referenced each unique value.  This mirrors the way
    one-dimensional deconvolution works on a flat peak list, with two
    additions:

    1.  **Deduplication.**  The same physical peak appears many times
        in the long FFC table (once per FFC it participates in).
    2.  **Charge-class partitioning.**  Values that collapse to the
        same charge-1-equivalent m/z but came from fragments with
        different precursor charges are kept in separate envelopes.
        A peak at m/z 229.66 measured as 2+ and a peak at m/z 458.31
        measured as 1+ both land at ~458.31 on the charge-1 axis, but
        they are different observations (possibly of the same species,
        but in different charge states) and should not be pooled into
        one envelope for isotope-spacing purposes.  Isotope spacing on
        the charge-1 axis is 1.003 Da regardless of the underlying
        precursor charge; what differs is which other peaks are
        physically part of the same envelope, and that is determined
        by the precursor charge, not by the transformed m/z.

    Why pool A and B together (within a charge class)?  Because a
    fragment that appears as ``m/z A`` in one FFC and as ``m/z B`` in
    another (at the same charge) is the same physical peak after the
    charge-1 transform.  Treating the two sides separately splits its
    isotope envelope and produces inconsistent monoisotopic assignments.

    Background augmentation
    -----------------------
    When ``bg_mz``, ``bg_int``, and ``bg_charges`` are provided, each
    envelope built from the selected FFC peaks is augmented with
    additional peaks from the full dataset ("background") that sit at
    integer multiples of the isotope spacing from existing envelope
    members but were not themselves part of the selected top FFCs.

    This addresses the edge case where a breakpoint has only one or
    two FFC points on its line: the envelope shape is too sparse for
    reliable monoisotopic selection.  By pulling in background peaks
    at the correct spacing, we capture the true envelope shape more
    faithfully, improving the cosine-similarity scoring.

    The background peaks only affect monoisotopic selection — they do
    NOT produce new output rows.  The output still contains only the
    originally selected FFC rows.

    Parameters
    ----------
    charges : np.ndarray, optional
        Per-row precursor charge.  When provided, envelope grouping is
        done independently per charge class.  When None, all rows are
        treated as a single pool (legacy behaviour).
    bg_mz : np.ndarray, optional
        Charge-1-equivalent m/z values from the full dataset (background).
    bg_int : np.ndarray, optional
        Intensities corresponding to ``bg_mz``.
    bg_charges : np.ndarray, optional
        Per-value original charge for the background values.

    Returns five items:

    Pool the charge-1-equivalent values from both sides of the FFC table
    and deconvolute them as a single 1D peak list, partitioned by
    precursor charge.

    The pooled approach is essential because a fragment can appear as
    ``m/z A`` in one FFC and as ``m/z B`` in another -- on the charge-1
    axis these are the same physical peak, and they need to share an
    envelope so they get one consistent monoisotopic assignment.

    The charge partitioning prevents mixing values that happen to
    collide on the charge-1 axis but come from different precursor
    charges (e.g., a 2+ peak at m/z 229.66 and a 1+ peak at m/z 458.31
    both land near 458.31 after the transform, but they are separate
    observations).

    When ``bg_mz``, ``bg_int``, and ``bg_charges`` are provided, each
    envelope is augmented with background peaks from the full dataset

    """
    Full FFC-line-based deconvolution.

    The caller supplies the complete FFC DataFrame (all rankings).  Two
    cutoff parameters control which rows play which role:

    * ``top_selected`` (default 2000): only the top-ranked FFCs up to
      this cutoff are deconvoluted and appear in the output.
    * ``top_bg`` (default 8000): the top-ranked FFCs up to this cutoff
      provide the m/z + intensity pool used for background envelope
      augmentation during monoisotopic selection.  Must be
      >= ``top_selected``.

    Line finding runs on the ``top_bg`` set (the larger pool) so that
    lines with many supporting points are detected even if only a few
    fall inside the ``top_selected`` subset.  Then only FFC points that
    are both (a) within ``top_selected`` and (b) assigned to a detected
    line are deconvoluted and returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : DataFrame
        Full FFC table.  Must contain ``mz_col_a``, ``mz_col_b``, and
        ``ranking_col``.  Rows with ``ranking_col == -1`` are dropped
        automatically (sentinel for unranked entries).
    parent_charge : int
        Charge state of the precursor (only lines with i + j == this
        value are used).
    parent_mass : float
        Neutral monoisotopic mass of the precursor (Da).
    expected_offsets : list of float
        Allowed Parent+X offsets to look for, in Da.  Detected lines
        whose Parent+X is not within ``offset_tol`` of one of these
        values are discarded.
    intensity_col_a, intensity_col_b : str, optional
        Per-peak intensity columns.  If absent, uniform intensities are
        used.
    theo_patt_path : str, optional
        Path to TopPIC theo_patt.txt for monoisotopic refinement.
    line_delta : float
        Clustering gap for line detection (Da).
    min_cluster_size : int
        Minimum points per line.
    offset_tol : float
        Tolerance for matching a detected line's Parent+X against the
        ``expected_offsets`` list.
    parental_offset : float
        Which entry of ``expected_offsets`` is the parental line.
    parental_tol : float
        Tolerance for identifying a line as parental.
    mz_tol : float
        Isotope-spacing tolerance on the charge-1-equivalent axis.
    max_shift : int, optional
        Maximum number of isotope steps for monoisotopic selection.
    top_selected : int
        Number of top-ranked FFCs to deconvolute and return.
    top_bg : int
        Number of top-ranked FFCs whose m/z + intensity values serve as
        the background pool for envelope augmentation.  Must be
        >= ``top_selected``.
    ranking_col : str
        Column used for ranking (lower value = higher rank).

    dict with keys "annotated", "replaced", "line_map".
